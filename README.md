## **Hangman** ##

This repo contains files created through Treehouse courses that have been updated & enhanced to play the game Hangman. For multiplayer, provide a word for the args value for others to guess. If no args value is provided the game has been enhanced to pull a random word from a pool of words for you to guess.

##### **The classes are as follows:** #####
* Hangman - Program's starting point, game continues while there are tries remaining and word has not been guessed.
* Prompter - Contains methods for what user will see ("Enter a guess", "Game Won/Loss", "Tries left" etc.)
* Game - Contains game logic (methods for guessing, getting remaining tries, progress, if game is won etc.)
* WordBank - contains random words that are pulled when no word is provided to be guessed.
