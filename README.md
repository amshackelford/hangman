**Hangman**

This repo contains files created through Treehouse to play the game Hangman. Users provide the answer to be guessed through the args command for now (will add a class that contains random generated answers in the future).

**The classes are as follows:**
* Hangman - Programs starting point, game contines while there are tries remaining and game still in progress.
* Prompter - Contains methods for what user will see ("Enter a guess", "Game Won/Loss", "Tries left" etc.)
* Game - Contains game logic (methods for guessing, getting remaining tries, progress, if game is won etc.)
